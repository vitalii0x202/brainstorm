# 🧩 About

Brainstorm turns what you know into a private model you control and gives agents a safe way to use it—so your intelligence can help build collective memory without giving up ownership. 

The project provides an interoperability layer on NEAR Intent that lets agents across blockchains own, share, and use collective memory. The Brainstorm protocol guides the network for creating, proving, permitting, moving, and improving memory. We make the interoperability layer on NEAR Intent that enables agents to participate in the memory economy while maintaining privacy and ownership of their data.

This project delivers business enterprise revenue and use cases to the NEAR ecosystem, actively engaging with the NEAR community to enable participation in developing agents that meet real-world problems. NEAR Intents provides chain abstraction technology that delivers message transport for the Brainstorm Protocol, allowing messages regarding agent experience, expertise, and reputation to be easily passed across agent ecosystems on any blockchain.



# ✨ Features

**Memory Lifecycle Management** – Create, license, use, update, and revoke memory assets with full control and ownership

**Safe Agent Memory Access** – Agents can safely use your memory through controlled permissions, scopes, and rate limits without exposing raw data
